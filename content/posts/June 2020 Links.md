The June's issue is late, sorry. I've been busy at work.

## Website

[Increment.com](https://increment.com/)
Well designed site that contains good articles, updated per 3 month issues. They offer a printed edition that looks good too. I haven't buy their printed edition yet, because the shipping to my country tagged twice the price of the books.

[Beginner's Guide to Abstraction](https://jesseduffield.com/beginners-guide-to-abstraction/) - **Jesse Duffield**
A complementary read to **Bret Victor**'s _Up and Down the Ladder of Abstraction_ (you can [read it here](http://worrydream.com/LadderOfAbstraction/)).

Highlight that I like:
> Duplication is far cheaper than the wrong abstraction.
> [_The Wrong Abstraction_](https://sandimetz.com/blog/2016/1/20/the-wrong-abstraction) -**Sandi Metz**


## Apps

[Boop](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/boop/id1518425043) &nbsp;<small>macOS App</small>
Great utility app to process many kind of text, it can pretty format HTML, XML and JSON, convert HEX color to rgb, and more trivial stuff. It is a great tool as I often open a web tool to do those things. I [made a custom script](/hex2rgb.js) for Hex to RGB based on the placeholder script.

[Org-roam](https://www.orgroam.com/)
I think, this is the end of my quest to search the best note taking app (on desktop, at the very least). I've written about it [on this post](/posts/2020-06-org-mode-with-org-roam/).

[SingleFile Browser Extension](https://github.com/gildas-lormeau/SingleFile)
Rotten link is one of my fear when bookmarking a site. **SingleFile** is a good site saver that generates only an html file. It's much easier and compact than "Save Page As..." browser function.

[historio.us](https://historio.us/)
Related to my [rant post](/posts/2020-06-on-trial-refund-support), I prefer historio.us as my site archiving service. Page caching system is better (i.e. not an `<iframe/>`), and search is easier.
