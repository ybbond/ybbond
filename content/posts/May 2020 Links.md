## Tech

📠 [Building a Memex - Andrew Louis](https://hyfen.net/memex/)
Awesome project! I think the name is hilarious because it sounds like Indonesian slang word for vagina.

🌳 [stagit - codemadness](http://codemadness.org/git/stagit/)
I like Luke Smith's [git site](https://git.lukesmith.xyz/) and emailed him asking how it's made.
He said it is stagit, and he mentioned list of other [awesome suckless tools](https://suckless.org/rocks/).

## Blog

🎭 [A More Privacy Friendly Blog - Vincent Bernat](https://vincent.bernat.ch/en/blog/2018-more-privacy-blog)

🗣 [Metaphors in man pages - Julia Evans](https://jvns.ca/blog/2020/05/08/metaphors-in-man-pages/)
Linguistic fascinates me. This post points out the often used metaphors in programming area. Nicely written too.

## App

📝 [FSNotes Mac & iOS App](https://github.com/glushchenko/fsnotes)
I used nvALT for Zettelkasten, `FSNotes.app` brings nvALT goodness and make it more stable, more pleasant UI and iOS app.

🔒 [Bitwarden](https://bitwarden.com)
Ever since Indonesian eCommerce [Tokopedia got hacked](https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/102666/data-breach/tokopedia-hacked.html), I changed all my passwords, enable 2FA for most, and make all of them different and use Password manager for convenience. Bitwarden is good, cheap and available everywhere.

👀 [Glance Mac App](https://github.com/samuelmeuli/glance)
A complementary for macOS's `Finder.app`. Add the ability to see most of source code and compressed file's content.
