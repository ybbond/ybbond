Quick note, there is error in link destinations at the end of the post. All directing to [https://github.com/xwmx/nb](https://github.com/xwmx/nb).

I too want to build a CMS! The convenience of editing anywhere, desktop or mobile devices, like using WordPress...
I think that would improve my willingness to write posts, or document stuffs.
