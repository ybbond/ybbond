I like listening to podcasts. I like to listen them on a dedicated podcast player. Dedicated podcast player means support for chapter markers, custom thumbnail, clickable timestamp on shownotes, etc.

Some of my favorite shows moved to be Spotify exclusives. I don't like Spotify as podcast player. I do like Spotify as music player.

[spotifeed.timdorr.com](https://spotifeed.timdorr.com) turns Spotify exclusive podcasts to a regular RSS feed for your favorite PODCAST player.
