It's awesome how influential Apple's decisions are.

macOS Big Sur introduced new icon design guidelines? 
Cross platform applications 'redesign' their icons for all platform.

Apple (re-)introduced ARM based architecture for desktop?
Cross platform app devs: "This is the time guys, now we must create ARM binary build for sure".
