Found this neat blog from the developer of Apple application «[Paper](https://paper.pro/)». They wrote about app store strategy [on Part 1](https://paper.pro/dev), some text handling mechanism with Objective-C [on Part 2](https://paper.pro/internals), and more nerdy stuff [on Part 3](https://paper.pro/apple-rich-text).

The interactivity on the 3rd part is really good, but unfortunately it does not work on Firefox.
