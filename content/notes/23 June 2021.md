I just knew this terminal utility [from Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/commandline/comments/o63q6f/file_manager_written_in_awk/):

[`fm.awk`](https://github.com/huijunchen9260/fm.awk), a file manager written in `awk`!

`awk` and `sed` are the tool I never useâ€”except some `sed`like commands in `vim`. Knowing the tool can be extended to be a TUI File Manager is mindblowing ðŸ¤¯
