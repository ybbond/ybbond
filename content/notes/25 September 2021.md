I've tried Fastmail, Google Workspace, Hey, Namecheap and my country's local company service for custom domain mail. Now I am using iCloud Custom Domain.

The service is included with my monthly iCloud Drive subscription, so basically free addition to service I already paid.

So far so good, the web interface is bad UX-wise tho. I cannot know exactly, but I hope Apple is true to their words on not spooping on my private emails.

If you are concerned with your privacy when contacting me, you can email me with text encrypted via PGP. See my PGP public key [in my contact page](/contact/).
