## Hardware

### Platforms

- Macbook Pro 2018 13" (Office)
- Macbook White Unibody mid 2010 (Experiments) [my note][mbwhite]
- Low End PC with Manjaro Linux XFCE (Home)
- iPad Mini 5 WiFi 64GB
- iPhone SE (2016) 128GB

### Peripherals

- Ducky One 2 Mini Keyboard [gif image on Twitter][ducky]
  <small>P/N <code>DKON1861ST</code></small>
- NuPhy NuType F1 Keyboard [my review post][nuphy]
- Roland Electric Piano FP-30
- Guitars. Many of them.


## Software

### Development

- **Neovim** [init.vim][nvim] 
- **Z Shell** (zsh) [.zshrc][zshrc]
  <small>now macOS use this as default shell.</small>
- **tmux** on **kitty** [tmux.conf][tmux], [kitty.conf][kitty]
- **nnn**, n³ The missing terminal file manager for X.
- **lazygit** [my post][lazygit]
- I also have license for **Sublime Text** and **Onivim 2** that I rarely use.

### Daily Applications

I use these app on both macOS and iOS (or iPadOS):

- **Canary mail**
  <small>lightweight email client with configurable keyboard shortcuts, and PGP encryption</small>
- **2Do App**
- **Reeder 4**
  <small>beautiful and gesture-based RSS Reader.</small>
- **BusyCal**
- **iA Writer** [my post about it][iawriter]
  <small>I write my Hugo post mostly with this app.</small>

### Working

To help on my working time, I use these apps:

- **Xit** Git GUI for macOS
  <small>When doing heavy refactor, I like to code while looking at the repository's history.
  [Xit][xit] is a free and open source. I think it is comparable to the awesome **Sublime Merge**.</small>
- **Ripcord** chat client for Slack and Discord
  <small>The official **Slack** and **Discord** desktop client uses **Electron**, I don't like that.
  [Ripcord][ripcord] is a shareware that is based on, I don't know, it looks like **GTK+**.</small>

### Services

- **Fastmail**
  <small>I try to use less Google, but I cannot find replacement for ~~YouTube~~ and Translate :(</small>
  <small>Thanks to [Josh Habdas](https://habd.as), I switched from Youtube to Invidio.us</small>
- **BitWarden** password manager
- **Worldbrain's Memex 2**
  <small>Browser extension to bookmark, highlight and annotate any site.
  With full text search and grouping, this is a good service for knowledge gathering.</small>
- **Historio.us**
  <small>Web archiver. It supports full text search and tagging.
  I use this side-by-side with **Memex 2**.</small>

### Zettelkasten

I use [zettelkasten](https://zettelkasten.de/) paradigm for my knowledge base and note-taking.

- **Emacs** with [Org-roam](https://github.com/org-roam/org-roam)
  <small>Org-roam is an awesome minor package for Org-mode.
  Read [my post about this](/posts/2020-06-org-mode-with-org-roam/).</small>
- **FSNotes** [screencast on Twitter][video]
  <small>a very good note taking app.
  if you are familiar with nvALT, FSNotes feels much better.</small>
- **aText**
  <small>alternative to TextExpander that is single purchase.
  my template to make Zettelkasten [is here](/blogging-and-noting.atext).</small>
